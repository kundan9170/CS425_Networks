# CS425 : Computer Networks
This repository contains our assignment submissions for the course CS425 (Computer Networks) at IITK (in group of 3).

### A1: Chat Server with Groups and Private Messages
Implemented a __multi-threaded TCP__ based __chat server__ written in __C++__. The server facilitates multiple clients to interact with one another via private messages, group messaging, and broadcasts. It includes authentication, message routing, and group management features.


### A2: DNS Resolution
Implemented DNS resolution using two methods - iterative lookup and recursive lookup.

### A3: TCP Handshake
Implemented TCP three-way handshake using raw UDP sockets.

### A4: Routing Protocols (DVR and LSR)
Implemented Distance Vector Routing (DVR) and Link State Routing (LSR) algorithms in C++ using an adjacency matrix as input which represents the router network.
